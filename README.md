# Tra Ngo

👋 Hi, I'm Tra, Huong-Tra Ngo, a computational biologist specializing in computer vision for molecular cell data analysis.

## 🎓 Education

- Ph.D. in Genes, Development, and Disease (Computational Biology Track), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (2025)
- B.S. in Mathematics and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas at Dallas (2018)

## 🔬 Research Experience
📑 Find my research at [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nGlTcS0AAAAJ&hl=en).

At UT Southwestern Medical Center, under Dr. Khuloud Jaqaman, my research focuses on:

- Developed computational image analysis pipeline combining 2 imaging modalities (Single Molecule Imaging and Quantitative Speckle Fluorescent Microscopy) for studying plasma membrane protein and cortical actin dynamic organization.
- Characterize relationship between cortical actin and plasma membrane protein (CD36, VEGFR2) dynamic organization in live cells (TIME, CHO).

## 🚀 Projects

### SMI-FSM

SMI-FSM (Single Molecule Imaging – Fluorescent Speckle Microscopy) is a software (in MATLAB) for the analysis of simultaneous two-color imaging data of plasma membrane proteins (via SMI) and cortical actin (via FSM).
